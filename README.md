## 📝 Game Description

This project is a recreation of the iconic **Super Mario Bros** level 1-1, a platform video game released by Nintendo in 1985 for the NES console. In this game, Mario must rescue Princess Peach by overcoming classic enemies and navigating levels full of obstacles and power-ups.

The story takes place in the Mushroom Kingdom, where Bowser has kidnapped the princess and locked her in his castle 🏰. Mario sets out on an adventure across 8 worlds to rescue her.

🎯 The goal is to reach the end of each level, defeating enemies and collecting coins 💰, until reaching the final castle 🏰.
